#### By _**Amber Farrington**_

## Description

_This project has the user enter 3, 5, or 15 as an input and the result appends below the input starting at the value 1 and going to the number but replacing the inputted number with the word "ping","pong", or "ping-pong"(See BDD info below for behaviors_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

## Behavior Driven Development

User Input    | Output  
------------- | -------------
3             | [1,2, "ping"]           
5             | [1,2,3,4, "pong"]
15            | [1-14, "ping-pong"]

_Input 1) The user enters the string "3" as an input, it is converted from a string into a number, and outputs appending values starting with 1, and on 3 it replaces 3 with the word "ping"_

_Input 2) The user enters the string "5" as an input, it is converted from a string into a number, and outputs appending values starting with 1, and on 5 it replaces 5 with the word "pong"_

_Input 3) The user enters the string "15" as an input, it is converted from a string into a number, and outputs appending values starting with 1, and on 15 it replaces 15 with the word "ping-pong"_

## Known Bugs

_The "active" state on the "Lets Play" Button does not cover the whole button when clicked. You have to click right on the text of the button in order to get the resulting appends for the user input_
