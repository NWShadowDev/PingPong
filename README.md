#### By _**Amber Farrington**_

## Description

_This project has the user enter 3, 5, or 15 as an input and the result appends below the input starting at the value 1 and going to the number but replacing the inputted number with the word "ping","pong", or "ping-pong"(See BDD info below for behaviors_

## Behavior Driven Development

User Input    | Output  
------------- | -------------
3             | [1,2, "ping"]           
5             | [1,2,3,4, "pong"]
15            | [1-14, "ping-pong"]
(any other #) | "Refresh and please enter a 3,5, or 15!"

_Input 1) The user enters a number and it goes through the array after the given number and then replaces the number with "ping", "pong", or "ping-pong"

_Input 2) The user enters the string "3" as an input, it is converted from a string into a number, and outputs appending values starting with 1, and on 3 it replaces 3 with the word "ping"_

_Input 3) The user enters the string "5" as an input, it is converted from a string into a number, and outputs appending values starting with 1, and on 5 it replaces 5 with the word "pong"_

_Input 4) The user enters the string "15" as an input, it is converted from a string into a number, and outputs appending values starting with 1, and on 15 it replaces 15 with the word "ping-pong"_

_Input 4) The user enters any number thats not 3,5, or 15 and gets an alert that says to refresh the page and to enter one of those three inputs_ _*(Update @ 9:10pm Friday 8/19: Alert has been removed)*_

## Known Bugs

_The "active" state on the "Lets Play" Button does not cover the whole button when clicked. You have to click right on the text of the button in order to get the resulting appends for the user input_

_The hover state for links has a similar behavior to the button active state._

_Alert message on "else" is displaying even for the input of 3,5,and 15._

_Viewport isn't working: Some PC's may need to adjust their resolution to view the CSS margin styles properly_
